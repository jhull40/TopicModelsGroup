# TopicModelsGroup
Repository put together for our topic modeling group discussions.

## What's Here
Currently, there is one jupyter notebook that reads in some sample data, produces a basic topic model using gensim, and then uses LDAvis to produce an interactive visualization for the data and model. This code is not optimized or designed in any way to create accurate models, only to allow a basic program to run as a sample for other models you may be interested in. For more information on gensim, [here is their most recent documentation.](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). For more information on pyLDAvis, [here is their documentation.](https://pyldavis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
